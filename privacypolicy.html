        information about you. The information you allow us to access varies by
        Application, and it is affected by the privacy settings you and your
        friends establish in that Application. Users can always refuse to supply
        personal identification information, except that it may prevent them
        from engaging in certain App related activities.</span>

        mobile device, such as your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP)
        address, or other persistent identifiers, and their
        hardware/software/firmware. Non-Personal Information also includes
